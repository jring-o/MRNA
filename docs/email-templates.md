Dear {applicantName},

Thank you for applying to MIRA!

We genuinely loved your application, your experience, and your ideas, and would love to work with you. Unfortunately, with limited spots available, we couldn't include everyone in the in-person workshop.

> We have placed you on our waitlist and will let you know if anything changes within the next two weeks.

Either way, we'll keep you in the loop regarding workshop development and activities. We hope you'll join us in our quest to modularize the scientific endeavor over the years to come.
