### **Purpose and Scope**

The Modular Interoperable Research Attribution team is dedicated to fostering an environment that enables innovative, collaborative, and community-driven advancements in open science. This event is a unique opportunity to bring together researchers, technologists, and leaders from diverse backgrounds to collectively explore and build the infrastructure and culture necessary for a more open, frictionless, and accessible research ecosystem.

The **purpose** of this Code of Conduct is to:

1. **Ensure Inclusivity and Equity**: Create an environment where all participants—regardless of background, identity, or experience—feel welcome, valued, and able to contribute meaningfully. Actively promote equity in voice by encouraging participation from historically underrepresented groups and ensuring that diverse perspectives are respected and included in all discussions.
2. **Promote Collaboration**: Encourage respectful engagement and curiosity, recognizing that multiple approaches to solving shared challenges enrich our collective understanding. Support participants in building forward relationships and fostering ongoing collaborations that extend beyond the event itself.
3. **Foster Safety and Community Accountability**: Establish a space where all participants share responsibility for maintaining a positive, inclusive environment. Encourage mutual respect, trust, and constructive interactions to ensure that everyone feels safe and supported throughout the event.

The **scope** of this Code of Conduct extends to:

- All participants, including attendees, speakers, organizers, volunteers, and sponsors.
- All event-related spaces, whether physical or virtual, including conference venues, social gatherings, online discussions, and communication channels such as email or Slack.

### **Encouraged Behavior**

All participants in the MIRA are expected to not be a PRIC and here’s how you do that proactively :))

1. **Protect**:
    - Commit to creating a space where all participants feel safe and valued.
    - Take responsibility for ensuring that personal and community behaviors align with the values of MIRA.
    - eg. Cede voice to those who might typically not talk, listen to people’s ideas. Criticize the idea not the person.
2. **Respect**:
    - Approach discussions with curiosity, patience, and an open mind.
    - Assume good intent while recognizing the impact of words and actions.
    - eg. Don’t play the blame game. If someone is impacting you (or you can see they’re impacting others) in a certain way and your comfortable having a convo, have it. If you’re not chat with us :)
3. **Include**:
    - Welcome and respect diverse perspectives, experiences, and identities.
    - Actively encourage and support participation from individuals across different backgrounds, particularly those from underrepresented groups.
4. **Construct**:
    - Contribute to building forward relationships and collaborations that extend beyond the event.
    - Share knowledge and insights in ways that promote mutual learning and progress.

### 4. Reporting **Mechanisms**

If you observe or experience any behaviors that represent a code of conduct violation, or a violation of your safety in the space please report it either to in person staff, or to our anonymous reporting form. We will handle all reports with as much discretion as possible. 

**Unsafe spaces ruin it for everyone**. We will have specific staff focused on maintaining this safe space, however we invite the entirety of the community to remind others of our standards when necessary. It’s trite, but if you see something say something :) 

Any written reports will be stored only for the purpose of enforcing the Code of Conduct and will not be shared outside of the safety team. 

You can report any violations [via this form](https://www.notion.so/Dashboard-f6479e4cb672445eb26622179d23bdbb?pvs=21), contact@scios.tech, or to staff at the event.
